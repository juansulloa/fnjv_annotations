# Manage manual annotations of FNJV recordings

Keep track of manual annotations performed on the FNJV recordings. Annotations are performed using Audacity and the following standards:

- Samples are heard and visually analyzed with a spectrogram
- Distorted signals (clipped or distorted by the microphone) are not annotated.
- Only samples that can be clearly identified are marked. Samples should be heard and observed in the spectrogram clearly.
- Consecutive samples can be mixed down if the silence between sounds is shorter than 5s.
- Annotate the presence of background species if they are clear (high SNR)

### Annotation codes

Each species is coded by the first three letters of the genus and the first three letters of the epithet, using all upper case letters. For example *Dendropsophus minutus* would be DENMIN.

Each sample is also annotated according to the following cases:
- Clear call of single species (CLR)
- Single species in chorus (CHO)
- Overlap with other sounds (MED)
- Overlap with other species (OVL)
- Distant call (FAR)
